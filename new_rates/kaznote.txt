However, please be careful to use them because of the following
reasons,
 
  i) They are slow to be performed.
 
 ii) In calculations of the reaction rates and the emission rates
     where neutrinos appear in initial states such as n + \nu_e --> p + e^- 
     (not final states such as n + e^+ --> p + \bar{\nu}_e ), the
     subroutines assume the perfect Fermi-Dirac distribution of neutrinos
     and anti-neutrinos.
 
So, you cannot use the reaction rates of (\Gamma_{n + \nu_e --> p +
e^-} and \Gamma_{n + \nu_e + e^+--> p } and \Gamma_{p + \bar{\nu}_e 
--> n + e^+ } when the neutrinos are optically thin.  That was because
I did not solve the energy transfer Boltzmann equations of neutrinos
which has been main crucial topics among experts of the core-collapsed 
SNe and difficult to calculate them. I have never tried to do
that. Instead of solving the Boltzmann equations correctly, I simply
adopted the approximate method to treat both the optically thick and
thin cases by introducing TDYN and Hcm and so on, and then including 
and excluding the initial state neutrinos although we know that
approximations should be correct in perfectly-optically thick and thin
limit cases, respectively. As I told you that this idle approximation
was discussed in Appendix B of Kohri-Narayan-Piran (05).
